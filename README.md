# Matrix-calculator-using-audio-input.
I have made a program that can perform matrix calculation it takes the input in audio form and also gives the output in audio form which makes it more interactive to use. I tried to explore some AI features with python programming .


File implentation order & their use 

i) audio.py- for listening & catching the audio input 

ii) texttospeech.py- module for converting the audio input into text 

iii) mainc.py- module for taking the audio input and converting them to text then requesting the user if audio in put is not clear

iv) start.py- program for integrating the previous modules and providing the entry- level interface to the user for performing different operations

v) matrix.py- program for performing matrix operation on getting the required text input
